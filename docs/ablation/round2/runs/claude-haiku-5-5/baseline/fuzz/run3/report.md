# Port report: fuzz

- **Result:** `model_finished` — model called finish (baseline: no loop-side success check)
- **Model:** `claude-haiku-5-5`
- **Iterations:** 5 / 10
- **Tokens:** in 20, out 3589, cache write 9779, cache read 29432; est. cost $0.0033
- **Best passing candidate:** none
- **Trace:** `trace.jsonl`

## Iterations

| it | tool | status | summary |
|----|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | migrate | ok | migrated 1 CUDA file(s) -> 1 file(s); 4 DPCT warning(s) (DPCT1009x1, DPCT1010x1, DPCT1024x2) |
| 2 | read_file | ok | fuzz.dp.cpp: 4333 chars |
| 2 | compile | ok | compiled 1 source(s) -> work/build/can... |
| 3 | write_file | ok | wrote migrated/fuzz.dp.cpp (1920 chars) |
| 3 | compile | ok | compiled 1 source(s) -> work/build/can... |

## What failed and what fixed it

- (no compile/verify failures)

## Final evidence

- **migrate** (it 1, sources `5a25d8f34f8c89d4`): `ok` — migrated 1 CUDA file(s) -> 1 file(s); 4 DPCT warning(s) (DPCT1009x1, DPCT1010x1, DPCT1024x2)
- **compile** (it 4, sources `b025899eb5f46485`): `ok` — compiled 1 source(s) -> work/build/candidate (0 warning(s))
- **scan_helpers:** not run
- **verify:** not run
- **benchmark:** not run

Current sources hash: `b025899eb5f46485`. Success requires compile, verify and zero-helper scan all on this hash.
